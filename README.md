## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict the magnitude of earthquakes in Central Asia. The dataset used in this project includes various features such as latitude, longitude, depth, date, and time of the earthquakes.

### Data Exploration

The data exploration phase includes:
- Loading and inspecting the dataset.
- Filtering and analyzing earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5.0.
- Visualizing the data using various plots (scatter plots, histograms, bar plots, etc.).
- Analyzing the distribution of earthquakes over time, by season, by day of the week, and by country.

### Data Visualization

Several visualizations are created to understand the patterns and distribution of earthquakes:
- 3D scatter plot of earthquake locations.
- Scatter plot of magnitude vs. depth.
- Histogram of earthquake magnitudes.
- Bar plot of earthquake counts by country.
- Distribution of earthquakes by month and season.
- Hourly and daily distribution of earthquakes.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict earthquake magnitudes. The models used include:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R^2 score. Hyperparameter tuning is performed on the Random Forest Regressor to improve its performance.

### Feature Importance

The importance of different features in predicting earthquake magnitudes is analyzed and visualized.
